## Bundle Metrics

- **Total Size**: N/A
- **Asset Count**: N/A
- **Chunk Count**: N/A





## Optimizations Applied

- ✅ Unused imports check completed
- ✅ Lazy loading is implemented
- ✅ Angular configuration optimized
- ✅ Webpack configuration optimized

## Warnings & Recommendations

- ⚠️ Bundle analysis failed: Command failed: ng build --stats-json
- ⚠️ Consider replacing rxjs with Ensure using specific imports from rxjs/operators
- ⚠️ Large library detected: chart.js - ensure it's lazy loaded when possible
- ⚠️ Large library detected: @angular/google-maps - ensure it's lazy loaded when possible
- ⚠️ Large library detected: primeng - ensure it's lazy loaded when possible
- ⚠️ Service worker setup failed: Command failed: ng add @angular/pwa --skip-confirmation

## Next Steps

1. Run `ng build --prod` to build optimized bundle
2. Use `ng build --stats-json` to generate detailed stats
3. Consider using webpack-bundle-analyzer for detailed analysis
4. Monitor bundle size in CI/CD pipeline
5. Regularly audit dependencies for updates and alternatives

## Performance Tips

- Use lazy loading for feature modules
- Implement OnPush change detection strategy
- Use trackBy functions in *ngFor loops
- Optimize images and use WebP format
- Enable gzip compression on server
- Use CDN for static assets
